	 - grow cascade selection is just a "select" followed by another "select"

	 - "select" followed by another "select" could also just be a re-select, qol so we don't need to first deselect

	 - move cursor w/w/o selection might have different keyboard arrow functionality
	   e.g. w/o a selection, only move the cursor to other cards
	   e.g. w/ a selection, only move the cursor to valid moves

	TODO (animations) (controls) use or remove - not sure what the point of this is
