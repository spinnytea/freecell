### Description

More control over where next card moves (i.e. cannot move to foundation if multiple valid moves)

- which is really because click-to-move is the only available control scheme on mobile
- this is solved with click-to-select, any keyboard, and drag-and-drop
- Can't put 3D in the foundation, it just waffles between 4S and 4C
